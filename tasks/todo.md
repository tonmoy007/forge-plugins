### T-002 — forge-init skill ✅ 2026-05-07
- `skills/forge-init/SKILL.md` with correct frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)
- `scripts/init-pipeline.sh` — idempotent, creates 12 stage dirs + tasks/ + .forge/
- `scripts/detect-project-type.py` — 5 project types, stdlib only, `--cwd` flag, JSON output
- `tests/unit/test_init_pipeline.py` — 5 tests passing
- `tests/unit/test_detect_project_type.py` — 9 tests passing
- 14/14 tests pass; plugin.json still validates

### T-001 — Plugin scaffolding ✅ 2026-05-07
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with all 7 hook registrations
- `scripts/validate-plugin.py` (stdlib only, exits 0)
- 7 executable stub hooks in `hooks/`
- `tests/unit/test_validate_plugin.py` — 5 tests passing
- Note: `python` resolves to Python 2.7 on this system; all commands use `python3`
